This authorization will remain in effect until I cancel it by notifying the Landlord, in writing, of any 
changes to my bank account information or my intent to terminate this authorization, pr oviding at least 
ten (10) days' notice prior to the next billing date as to allow the Landlord reasonable time and 
opportunity to act on changes. If the Rent Due Date falls on a weekend or holiday, I understand that the 
payments may be executed on the next  available business day. For ACH debits to my checking/savings 
account, I understand that, because these are electronic transactions, funds may be withdrawn from my 
account as soon as the Rent Due Date arrives. In the event an ACH transaction is rejected f or Non -
Sufficient Funds (NSF), I understand that the Landlord may, at their discretion, attempt to process the Page 17 charge again within thirty (30) days, and I agree that there shall be a fee of $20 for each attempted and 
returned NSF, all of which will be init iated as a separate transaction from the authorized recurring 
payment described herein.

States will apply. I certify that I am an authorized user of the above -stated bank account and will not
