Advanced demo of a Discord chatbot with an LLM back end

Demonstrates async processing via ogbujipt.async_helper & Discord API integration.
Users can make an LLM request by @mentioning the bot by its user ID

Note: This is a simple demo, which doesn't do any client-side job management,
so for example if a request is sent, and a second comes in before it has completed,
the LLM back end is relied on to cope.

Additional prerequisites: discord.py

Also need to make sure Python has root SSL certificates installed
On MacOS this is via double-clicking `Install Certificates.command`

Requires the following environment variables:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}
LLM_BASE=http://my-llm-host:8000
LLM_TEMP=0.5
```

For some discussion of setting up the environment: https://github.com/OoriData/OgbujiPT/discussions/36

Then to launch the bot:

```shell
python demo/alpaca_simple_qa_discord.py
```

You can then @mention the bot in a Discord channel where it's been added & chat with it

For hints on how to modify this to use OpenAI's actual services,
see demo/alpaca_simple_fix_xml.py
