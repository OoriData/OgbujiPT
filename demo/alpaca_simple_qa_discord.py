'''
Advanced demo of a Discord chatbot with an LLM back end

Demonstrates async processing via ogbujipt.async_helper & Discord API integration.
Users can make an LLM request by @mentioning the bot by its user ID

Note: This is a simple demo, which doesn't do any client-side job management,
so for example if a request is sent, and a second comes in before it has completed,
only the latter will complete.

You need access to an OpenAI-like service. Default assumption is that you
have a self-hosted framework such as llama-cpp-python or text-generation-webui
running. Say it's at my-llm-host:8000, you can do:

Prerequisites: python-dotenv discord.py

You also need to make sure Python has root SSL certificates installed
On MacOS this is via double-clicking `Install Certificates.command`

You also need to have a file, just named `.env`, in the same directory,
with contents such as:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}
LLM_HOST=http://my-llm-host
LLM_PORT=8000
LLM_TEMP=0.5
```

Then to launch the bot:

```shell
python demo/alpaca_simple_qa_discord.py
```
